# API Testing

API testing is a type of testing that involves verifying and validating APIs and Web services. Unlike traditional testing which focuses on functionality on the GUI interacted by end users, API testing checks APIs used by developers and occurs at the middle layer of the software (e.g., headless or GUI-less components, usually invisible to end-users).

# Web Services
Web service supports interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network
