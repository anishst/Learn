# Agile Testing
Agile software development has resulted in burning down the silos of the traditional waterfall development methodology. 

Agile Manifesto:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

## Agile Metrics

- **Sprint velocity**: Velocity is the amount of work completed by the agile team in a given period of time. Sprint velocity is basically the rate at which the conditions mentioned in the software requirements specifications get converted into lines of tested code, or the number of story points covered by the team on every sprint.
- **Sprint burndown**: Also known as the burndown chart, this is a graphical representation of estimated tasks planned and the actual tasks completed.
