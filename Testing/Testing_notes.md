## Levels of Testing
- Unit testing - verify your code at the level of functions and classes; positive and negative testing at the lowest layers of 
code; first safety net for catching bugs; should run fast; automate
- Component Testing - library and complied binary level tests
- System Testing - tests the external interfaces of a system which is a collection os sub-systems
- Performance Testing - testing done at sub-system and system levels to verify timing resource usages are acceptable
