Docker
===================================
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. 
Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.

- software container
- NOT a VM; docker engine takes care of OS
- Engine shares kernel with diff containers

Hypervisor-based Virtualization
====================================
providers: VMWare, VirtualBox, Hyper-V

Benefits:
- cost-efficient
- easy to scale
Limitation:
- kernerl resource duplication
- application portability issue

Container-based Virtualization
================================
Benefits:
-runtime isolation
-cost-efficient
-less memory 
-fast deployment
-guarateed portability


Docker Architecture
============================================================
• image is the application we want to run
•container is an instance of that image running as a process
•possible to have multiple containers running of the same image
•dockers default image "registry" is called Docker Hub

Registries and Repositories

- registry is where we store our images
- you can host your own registry or can use dockers publich registry
called Docker Hub

Steps to Install - Windows
========================================
Docker for windows - windows 10 machines; has built-in VM; preferred method
Docker Toolbox - windows version older than win10

1.Download docker https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#download-docker-for-windows
2.Download URL: https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20for%20Windows%20Installer.exe
3.After install make sure to switch to Windows Containers

Running a test container (busybox):
==============================================
docker run busybox:1.24
docker run busybox:1.24  echo "Hello world"
docker run busybox:1.24 ls / - shows directories in the root directory of image
docker run -i  -t busybox:1.24 - run container in interactive mode; similiar to running cmd windows inside container

Docker Network defaults
=======================
- each container connected to private virtual network bridge
