## AWS Fundamentals: IAM & EC2

### AWS Management Console
 - use MFA 
 
### AMI - Amazon Machine Image
 - EC2 is based off AMI; similiar to docker image
 - OS + setup of software pre-installed
 - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html
 - use AMI TO pre-install software > faster boot
    - AMI is region based
    
### Setup

https://infrastructure.aws/

- regions
    - geo locations / isolated from each other
    - consist of at least 2 availablity zone
- availablity zones
    - clusters of data centers / min 2 AZ in a region
    - isolated from other zones
    - connecte by a low-latency link
    - edge locations host a CDN

### Amazon EC2

- Virtual machines that provides resizable compute capacity in cloud
- Amazon EC2 Instance Types: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/index.html
- instance lifecycle: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html
    - charged while in rebooting and running state
 - metadata: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html
 - Purchase options: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-purchasing-options.html
 - EC2 Launch modes:
    - on-demand - pay as you go
    - reserved - 1-3 yr contract
    - dedicated - dedicated hardware; nonshared
    - spot - bidding unused instances
- billed by the second; t2.micro is free tier
- security groups can reference other security groups instead of IP ranges
- default user accounts: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/managing-users.html

#### Connection Options for EC2

Connect options: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-connect-methods.html

**SSH**

- create new key pair
- save PEM file
- edit Edit inbound rules to allow SSH (SSH /TCP / 25 / Anywhere)
- form a terminal window go to directly with PEM file and enter this command: ```ssh -i ec2_tutorial.pem ec2-user@ipaddress```
- on linux you might need give permissionS if get error "bad permissions" : ```chmod 400 file.pem```
- if you need to run commands as root: ```sudo su```
- if u need to upgrade: ```yum update -y```
- on windows make your the owner of the pem file; disable inheritance and make sure you only have accessa nd have full control

Via browser using EC2 Instance connect

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html

- Quick start: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/vmlaunch/welcome.html


### Sample script to setup a web server

below script can be used to test an EC2 instance; 

the script will:
- install apache (httpd)
- config web server to automatically start on boot
- activate web server
- create a simple web page
```shell script
#!/bin/bash
yum -y install httpd
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd
echo "<html><body bgcolor=#D7EDF5><h1>Hello Anish! Welcome to your AWS Web Server $(hostname -f)!</h1></body></html>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```
Note: make to sure edit security group to allow HTTP access: Security Groups > web server security group > inbound rules tab > edit > add rule > type: HTTP Source: Anywhere > Save rules
### Getting log from EC2 instance

- Actions > Instance Settings > Get System Log

## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
 - for networking
 - users private cloud in a region
 - **Subnets**
    - logicl grouping of resources within the VPC
    - public subnet - can access from interent
    - private subnet
 - **Internet Gateway** connects VPC to internet
 - IPV4 CIDR 10.0.25.0/24 means the subnet contains ip addresses from 10.0.25.0 to 10.0.25.255
 - each subnet is assoicated with a **route table**, which specifies the routes for outbound traffic leaving the subnet
 - a **network acces control list (ACL)** is an optional layter of security for VPC; usually left with default values; act as firewall for controlling traiffc in/out of subnets
 - a **Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway** allows resources in a private subnet to connect to internet
- Guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html
- Security gropus compare: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Security.html
- VPC Flow logs
    - capture ip traffic info
- VPC Peering
    - connect 2 VPCs privately using AWS network
    - not transitive 
- VPC Endpoints
    - allows you to connect to AWS services using private network 
    - VPC Endpoit gateway: give VPC access to S3, DynamoDB
- Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect

## High Availability and Scalability: ELB & ASG

- Vertical scalability 
    - increase size of instance; ex. t2.micro to t2.large
- horizontal scalability 
    - increase number of instances
